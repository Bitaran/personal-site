abstract: Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models are widely used models in current monetary literature and research. DSGE models builds on the premise that economic agents derive decision rules by optimization of intertemporal problems, based on the assumptions about preferences and technology. I use a standard DSGE model with features such as habit formation, adjustment cost for capital accumulation and variable capacity utilization to model the effect of negative monetary shock on inflation. I use the model to estimate the effect of monetary shock and various other shocks in the model. The effects of these shocks were measured for inflation, output, and consumption. I use two different sample period. The first period considered is pre-recession (Jan 1980-Dec 2008) and the second period is post-recession (Jan 2008- Sep 2020). From the estimation from pre- and post-recession data, it can be argued that for both times frame the response of the variables to the shocks are qualitatively the same. It can also be concluded that the "price Puzzle" from the empirical papers is not seen in the DSGE models.
